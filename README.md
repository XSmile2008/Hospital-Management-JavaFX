# Hospital Management / JavaFX
An Hospital Management app for registering patients and treatment details.
Project done as part of my course requirements at NIIT Lagos.
_**Built for learning purposes**_

#### Built based on the following model
The front desk assistant handles the Out Patient (OP) registration details. When a patient comes for admission or consultation, the front desk assistant makes the required entries in the OP file. The front desk assistant provides an OP number and then the patient is referred to the concerned doctor, such as physician, surgeon, Eyes Nose Throat (ENT) specialist, or dentist. 
The concerned departmental assistant then makes the entry of the patient in the In-Patient (IP) file and provides an IP number. The patient is then referred to an available doctor and the treatment process starts.
